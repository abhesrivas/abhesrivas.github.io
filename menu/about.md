### My Background
I was born and raised in [Varanasi, India](https://www.britannica.com/place/Varanasi "Want to read up about Varanasi?"), one of the oldest continously inhabited cities in the world.

In 2016, I moved to New Delhi, India to join Shiv Nadar University (youngest university to be declared an Institute of Eminence by the Govt of India) where I graduated from as a CS major with a minor in mathematics in 2020.

Until early 2021, I was a research assistant at **U**biquitous **K**nowledge **P**rocessing Lab, TU Darmstadt working with [Dr. Nils Reimers](https://www.nils-reimers.de/vita) and [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/staff_ukp/prof_dr_iryna_gurevych/index.en.jsp) on cross-domain information retrieval systems.

For my thesis semester from January to July 2020, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research India working with Dr Monojit Choudhury and Dr Kalika Bali as a part of [Project Mélange](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/melange/).

During the summer of 2019, I interned with [Dr Djamé Seddah](http://atoll.inria.fr/~seddah/) as a part of [Team ALMAnaCH](https://files.inria.fr/almanach/people-en.html) at Inria Paris.

In my free time, I learn whatever musical instrument I can lay my hands on including but not limited to: _Harmonium_ (Indian Reed Instrument), _Bansuri_ (Indian bamboo flute), harmonica, keyboard, guitar and the ukulele.
