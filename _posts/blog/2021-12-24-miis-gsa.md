08/23/2021: An impromptu MIIS gathering at the Schenley plaza after orientation.

There is a famous CS joke that goes,
> How can you tell if a computer scientist is an introvert or an extrovert? \\
> The introvert computer scientist looks at his own shoe while talking while the extrovert looks at the shoes of the person they are talking with.

What _bulls**t_, right? Such generalisation can't be right â€“ I wonder... sitting at my laptop without any breaks
