Dear Internet,

Two days ago I accepted the offer to intern with the Siri Team at Apple. I shared this news on LinkedIn and since then I have been overwhelmed by the wishes I have received. Many also posed queries about the interview process and the preparation required to crack it.

In this post, I will share my experience along with the tips I have to prepare for such an interview.

### This is not a masterclass

Before we start, let's go over some basic considerations,
* I interviewed for the **AIML Intern** position which is different from other roles (such as SDE) and therefore, this post might not reflect how the process looks for other roles.
* Even within AI/ML, my research field is primarily focused on NLP and therefore, it is possible that the rounds look different for other fields.
* Finally, each interviewer has a unique interviewing style and experiences/rounds may widely differ for the same role. Therefore, read my experience as only an _experience_ and not a masterclass!

### Phase one: Pre-interview
I applied for the role in early October with a referral from a senior. I messaged him on LinkedIn and kindly asked if he could refer me for the role. I heard back from the recruiter the following month in November asking for my availability to schedule the interviews.

I was told that _usually_, there are two rounds of interviews but the team can have more if required.

### Phase two: Interviews

#### 1. Live-coding
The first round was a live-coding round where I was asked to solve a coding problem on [coderpad.io](https://coderpad.io) (one of my favourite live-coding platforms!) It was an array problem and would probably fall into the `medium` category on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com). The interviewer was very interactive and swiftly answered all my clarification questions. After I solved the problem, they asked me to discuss the time complexity of the code which I did. We were left with ~15 minutes out of the allotted one hour when the interviewer asked me to get ready for the second question. My heart skipped a beat – there's one more? There wasn't. They were joking (_*sigh*_). We both laughed and proceeded to the final part where I could ask them any questions that I had.

The next day I heard back from the recruiter – I had made it to the next round.
